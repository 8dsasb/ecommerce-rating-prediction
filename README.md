# E-commerce Rating Prediction

Predicting product ratings given user and item features using linear regression.

## 📄 Overview
This project builds a regression model to predict how users rate items on an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes user demographics, product category, and price information.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Feature encoding and selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R²

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
- Mean Absolute Error: 0.43
- R² Score: 0.79
- Training time: <1s

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add user-item interaction features
- Try advanced regression models (Ridge, Random Forest)
- Perform feature importance analysis
