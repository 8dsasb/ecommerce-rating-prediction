# E-commerce Rating Prediction

Predicting product ratings given user and item features using linear regression.

## Overview
This project builds a regression model to predict how users rate items on an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes user demographics, product category, and price information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Feature encoding and selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R¬≤

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Results
**Best performing Model**: Model C

**Worst performing Model**: Model B

**Highest MSE**: Approximately 1.80 (Model B)

**Highest RMSE**: Approximately 1.35 (Model B)

**Lowest MSE**: Approximately 1.72 (Model C)

**Lowest RMSE**: Approximately 1.30 (Model C)

## üí° Future Improvements
- Add user-item interaction features
- Try advanced regression models (Ridge, Random Forest)
- Perform feature importance analysis
